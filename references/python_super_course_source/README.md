## The Python Calculator Project

Throughout the assignments in this guide, you'll build a professional-grade calculator application that evolves from simple functions to a complete production-ready system. This progression demonstrates how modern software is developed:

**Foundation Setup (Assignment 0):**
- Professional development environment and mindset establishment
- Essential tool configuration and workflow foundation

**Foundation Assignments (1-4):**
- Setting up proper development environments
- Implementing test-driven development
- Ensuring code quality through linting
- Using professional Git workflows

**Professional Development (Assignments 5-8):**
- Implementing continuous integration and deployment
- Modern configuration management and secrets handling
- Python packaging and distribution to PyPI
- Production deployment with containerization and monitoring

By the end, you'll have a fully functional calculator with basic and scientific operations, memory management, a command-line interface, web API, comprehensive testing, CI/CD pipeline, and production deployment capabilities.

## Progressive Learning Path

The assignments follow a deliberate progression that mirrors complete professional software development lifecycles:

0. **Environment Setup** ‚Üí Professional development environment and mindset
1. **Environment Management** ‚Üí Virtual environments and dependency management
2. **Code Quality** ‚Üí Professional coding standards and documentation
3. **Testing** ‚Üí Test-driven development and automated testing
4. **Version Control** ‚Üí Professional Git workflows and collaboration
5. **CI/CD** ‚Üí Automated testing, security scanning, and deployment
6. **Configuration** ‚Üí Environment management, logging, and secrets
7. **Packaging** ‚Üí Modern Python packaging and PyPI distribution
8. **Deployment** ‚Üí Production-ready deployment with monitoring

Each assignment builds directly on the previous one, creating a complete software development journey from initial setup to production deployment.

## Historical Context

This guide teaches tools and practices that evolved over decades of software development:

- **Python** was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991, with Python 3 releasing in 2008
- **Version control** evolved from RCS (1982) to CVS (1990) to SVN (2000) to Git (2005)
- **Test-driven development** emerged in the late 1990s as part of Extreme Programming
- **Continuous integration** concepts date back to the 1990s but became mainstream in the 2010s
- **Code linting** tools have roots in the 1978 Unix "lint" program for C
